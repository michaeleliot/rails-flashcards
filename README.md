# README
Rails app used to learn ruby on rails and see [hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) in action. As someone with a lot of experience in javascript codebases, it was a nice change of pace to not have much javascript code. The other big advantage is deployment to other platforms. Having a native ios/android app built in is a huge benefit as well.

There are still some things I think are worth exploring
* Turbo stream seems very powerful for real time apps. Flashcards didn't take strong advantage of it.
* The turbo container seems to struggle when having to update multiple sections of state, especially sections that update different sections themselves. While the javascript is gone, state management issues on the client are still present.
